# dl-stuff-from-youtube

Basically just a Python file that uses one imported library.

Doesn't contain a lot of fancy functions, but it's simple and does it's job.

You'll be able to download just a single YouTube video or whole playlists. You can decide if you want just the audio file or video+audio. 

W/e if you're a music producer with a YouTube playlist full of songs you want to sample, this might come handy.
